  <h2>html 대신 내가 좋아하는 When will my life begin</h2><p>I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery I'll play guitar and knit and cook and basically just wonder <strong>when will my <u>life</u> begin</strong></p>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification"> Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup</a>
  Start on the chores and sweep 'till the floor's all clean
  Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up
  Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15</p>
  <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%"><p>And so I'll read a book
  Or maybe two or three
  I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
  I'll play guitar and knit
  And cook and basically
  Just wonder when will my life begin?
  Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking
  Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess
  Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making
  Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb
  <br>Sew a dress!</p>
